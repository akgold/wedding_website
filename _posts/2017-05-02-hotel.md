description: We've got 30 rooms blocked for Saturday and Sunday nights at the <a href = http://warrenton.hamptoninn.com>Hampton Inn Warrenton</a> (501 Blackwell Road Warrenton, Virginia, 20186, USA). You can book on the <a href = http://warrenton.hamptoninn.com>website</a> or by calling 540-349-4200 and use code <strong>AGW</strong> for the group rates. Check in is at 3pm and early check in is not possible, so we recommend booking for both Saturday and Sunday nights. <br><br>We will be running a shuttle to and from the hotel. Details on that forthcoming.
