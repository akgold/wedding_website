description: The Hampton Inn, Warrenton, VA is about 34 miles/40 minutes from where 495 (Beltway) meets 66 and 35 miles/45 minutes from Dulles Airport. <br><br>Wollam Gardens is less than a 20-minute drive further from the hotel. <br><br>Choices for accommodations are limited in the area and itâ€™s a busy holiday weekend, so we suggest making your reservations as early as possible.<br><br>Our hotel block at the <a href = http://warrenton.hamptoninn.com>Hampton Inn Warrenton</a> (501 Blackwell Road Warrenton, Virginia, 20186, USA) is <strong>full</strong>, but there are still rooms available for Sunday night. Please make sure to tell them that you're with our party if you book a room there.<br><br>Check in at the Hampton Inn is at 3pm and the hotel has, unfortunately, been very firm that early check-in is not possible. The wedding ceremony will start promptly at 4:30 so it might be very tight to try to check in before the ceremony.<br><br>We will be running a shuttle between the hotel and the wedding venue or you can drive directly if you prefer. There will be plenty of parking at the venue. <br><br>We are aware that rooms are running low at the Hampton Inn. We would suggest looking at the <a href = https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/warrenton/wrvva/hoteldetail>Holiday Inn Express</a> or the <a href = https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/baymont/warrenton-virginia/baymont-inn-and-suites-warrenton/overview>Baymont Inn & Suites</a> for other options in a similar price range.<br><br>For more upscale options, please check out the <a href = https://www.blackhorseinn.com/the-inn>Black Horse Inn</a>, <a href = https://www.airlie.com/>Arlie</a>, <a href = https://www.thechiltonhouse.com/>Chilton House</a>, or the <a href = http://poplarspringsinn.com/>Poplar Springs Inn</a>.
