description: The Hampton Inn, Warrenton, VA is about 34 miles/40 minutes from where 495 (Beltway) meets 66 and 35 miles/45 minutes from Dulles Airport. <br><br>Wollam Gardens is less than a 20-minute drive further from the hotel. <br><br>Choices for accommodations are limited in the area and itâ€™s a busy holiday weekend, so we suggest making your reservations as early as possible.<br><br>We've got rooms blocked for Saturday and Sunday nights at the <a href = http://warrenton.hamptoninn.com>Hampton Inn Warrenton</a> (501 Blackwell Road Warrenton, Virginia, 20186, USA). You can book on the <a href = http://warrenton.hamptoninn.com>website</a> or by calling 540-349-4200 and use code <strong>AGW</strong> for the group rates. Group rates are only available if booking for <strong>both</strong> nights.<br><br>Check in is at 3pm and the hotel has, unfortunately, been very firm that early check-in is not possible. The wedding ceremony will be late afternoon so it might be very tight to try to check in before the ceremony. We recommend booking for both Saturday and Sunday nights, if possible. <br><br>We will be running a shuttle between the hotel and the wedding venue or you can drive directly if you prefer. There will be plenty of parking at the venue.
