description: For those of you in the DC area, Jeffersonton is a 1.5 hour drive from downtown DC. For Winchester folks, it's just over an hour. For people coming from a bit further away, <a href = http://www.flydulles.com/iad/dulles-international-airport>Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD)</a> is the closest airport; it's about an hour drive. Washington National Airport (DCA) is a little over an hour.
