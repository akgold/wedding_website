description: Our wedding will be a fairly traditional Jewish wedding, so it'll be short, sweet, and occasionally incomprehensible if you don't speak Hebrew. But don't worry! We'll be providing plenty of info here and in your programs day-of, so you'll always know what's going on and how you can join in the fun!<br><br>The wedding ceremony will begin at around 4:30. We will sign our Ketubah (traditional Jewish marriage contract) a bit before that.<br><br>Hotel check-in at The Hampton Inn is 3:00 pm and they will not allow early check-in. We will be running a shuttle between The Hampton Inn and Wollam Gardens, or you can drive directly if you prefer.
