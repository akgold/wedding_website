description: The wedding ceremony will begin at around 4:30. We will sign our Ketubah (traditional Jewish marriage contract) a bit before that.<br><br>Please be aware that the hotel checkin time is at 3 and they have been very insistent that they will not allow early checkin. We will plan for the bus to leave the hotel at 3:30. If you are planning to stay only Sunday night and want to leave your car at the hotel, please let us know and we can help you make arrangements. If you wish to drive there is plenty of parking (as well as a parking attendant) at the venue.
