description: We can't wait to see you looking good; please consider appropriate footwear for an outdoor wedding. <br><br>Our wedding will be a fairly traditional Jewish wedding, so it'll be short, sweet, and occasionally incomprehensible if you don't speak Hebrew. But don't worry! We'll be providing plenty of info here and in your programs day-of, so you'll always know what's going on and how you can join in the fun!<br><br>The wedding ceremony will begin at 4:30.<br><br>Hotel check-in at The Hampton Inn is 3:00 pm and they will not allow early check-in. <br><br>Shuttles will depart from the hotel for Wollam Gardens at 3:25 and 4:05. At the end of the night, shuttles will depart Wollam Gardens for the hotel at 9:30 and 10:40. Parking is available at Wollam Gardens for those who wish to drive themselves.
